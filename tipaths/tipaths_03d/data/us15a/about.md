# Case study ___us15a___

This case study is based on hourly data from 13 Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (hereafter WSR-88D) stations in the northeastern United States from the National Climatic Data Center. Hourly data was selected from within a 37.5 km radius of each radar station and up to 3000 m above the radar station for all scans between local civil twilight dusk and dawn, beginning after sunset on 8 September to sunrise on 11 September 2010.

The json files containing the data are generated by the `process_csv_us15a` NodeJS app in `tipaths_03d/data_work/`.
