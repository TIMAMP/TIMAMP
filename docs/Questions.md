- Assume that in a window of say 30 min we have 4 observations (from one radar at one altitude). Assume that for 3 out of these 4 the radial_velocity_std is < 2. Consequently the bird_density is 0 for those 3. Assume it is 5 for the fourth observation. What is the average bird_density for this window? 5 or 5/4? What is the average u_speed? 

- The ground_speed given in the dataset is not equal to the square root of the sum of the powers two of speed_u and speed_v. Why?
