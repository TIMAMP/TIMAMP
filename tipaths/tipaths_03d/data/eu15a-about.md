# Case study ___eu15a___

This case study is based on data from five operational weather radars (De Bilt and Den Helder in the Netherlands; Jabbeke, Zaventem and Wideumont in Belgium) from 5 April 2013 00:00 UTC to 12 April 2013 00:00 UTC. The methods described in (Dokter et al., 2011) were used to process the radar data and extract bird migration altitude profiles applying a calibration for passerine migration to convert reflectivity into bird densities (birds km-3). The processed data consists of an altitude profile extracted every 5 minutes per radar from all pulse volumes within 5-25 km of each radar station up to a sampling altitude of 4000 m above the radar station, including the start and end date and time (UTC) of each 5 minute scan, the 200m altitude bin (from 0.1 up to 5.9 km), the standard deviation of the radial velocity (σ_r,the speed of targets relative to the radar), the bird reflectivity (cm2 km-3) converted to bird density (ρ_bird, birds km-3), the vertical and horizontal ground speed components (u and v components towards east and north respectively in m/s).

The lowest altitude bin (0-200 m, 0.1 km in dataset) contains influence of ground clutter -radar reflectivity generated by targets on the ground- and is best excluded from visualisations. It is also best to consider altitude bands up to 4000 m following (Dokter et al., 2011, Kemp et al., 2010, Van Gasteren et al., 2008).

## Query template

The query is a variation of the query proposed [here](https://github.com/enram/case-study/tree/master/data/bird-migration-altitude-profiles#aggregation).
This variation aggregate altitudes depending on the template parameter ___strataSize___.

The resulting records also contain the values:

* avg_speed
* altitude_idx
* interval_idx
